### Questions

#### Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 1 and all related cases that use inline code with backticks? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.

My program passed for Snippet 1. My code only finds the brackets and parentheses and skips other characters, even if they are in between the brackets and parentheses. It finds those brackets and parentheses and only pays attention to the elements between the brackets and parentheses.

#### Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 2 and all related cases that nest parentheses, brackets, and escaped brackets? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.

My program passed for Snippet 2. My code finds the first opening and first closing bracket and parenthesis in the file. 

#### Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 3 and all related cases that have newlines in brackets and parentheses? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.
